        A tutor, formally also called an academic tutor,
        is a person who provides assistance or tutelage to one or more people on certain subject areas or skills.</p>

      High tuition rates and a lack of customization in traditional education are driving many students to
       seek alternatives to obtaining a college education from traditional colleges and universities.

  “I come from a poor family. At home it’s one room, just a room we live in.
  When I was a child, I used to fear mathematics. But now, I am in love with mathematics because of tutoring center.”
